# Beaver Jump!

## Overview
**Beaver Jump** is a fun variation of the classic game Doodle Jump, with a twist: the player controls a beaver. The goal is to jump as high as possible on randomly spawning tiles, collecting points and power-ups, while avoiding falling off the screen or getting hit by bullets fired from an invader. The game features an elastic jumping mechanic, multiplayer mode, and engaging visual elements, making it an exciting challenge for players of all skill levels.

## Gameplay
Players navigate the beaver using keyboard controls (arrow keys for one player, AWD keys for another in multiplayer) to jump on tiles and avoid enemy bullets. As the player advances, the screen scrolls upward, generating new tiles and removing old ones. Points are scored based on how high the player can go, and the game ends if the beaver falls or is hit by a bullet.

The game includes:
- Randomly spawning tiles
- Moving and disappearing tiles
- Invader shooting bullets at random intervals
- Power-ups, such as springs, trampolines, and shields
- Parachutes for falling beavers
